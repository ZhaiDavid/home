	    <h1>No Ordinary Pie</h1>
        <p>
		Have you ever wanted to have a pie, more specifically a pie with fishheads staring deep into your soul with every
		bite that you take? Well, me neither, but such food exists nonetheless. Coming from the tiny village of Mousehole 
		in England, say hello to the stargazy pie!
		</p>
		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<p>
		It goes without doubt that the fish is a stargazy pie&rsquo;s defining characteristic, with the traditional 
		fish of choice being sardines. For the sake of a cleaner meal, it is preferred to have the sardines skinned and boned. 
		Other traditional ingredients include thickened milk, eggs and boiled potatoes. <a href = "#Source_1">[1]</a>
		</p>
		<h2>An Epic Origin</h2>
		<p>
		There goes a legend, where a mighty fisherman by the name of Tom Bawcock single-handedly saved the village of
		Mousehole from starvation during a winter of extreme conditions. The man bravely set out on a fishing trip when 
		nobody else would and caught enough fish to feed the village&rsquo;s entirety. The fish were then all baked into a pie, 
		and the rest was history. <a href = "#Source_2">[2]</a>
