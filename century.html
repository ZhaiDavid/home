	    <h1>Century Egg</h1>
		<p>
		Contrary to what its name suggests, a century egg is far from ancient and a Chinese delicacy enjoyed by many. Despite its initial 
		off-putting appearance, it may not be as bad as you think!
		</p>
		<h2>Taste</h2>
		<p>
		As a fellow Chinese, century eggs have accompanied my meals every once in a while, but even after all these years, it feels like
		I&rsquo;m eating something new each time. Its flavour is distinctively strong and unique like no other, along with
		a much creamier yolk and saltier taste than usual. 
		</p>
		<h2>Preparation</h2>
		<p>
		Traditionally, duck, chicken, or quail eggs are preserved in a mixture of tea, quicklime, salt and ashes along with water. The eggs 
		are then covered with rice hulls to prevent them from sticking together. This process typically takes 10 to 30 days based on the
		weather &#40;the hotter the quicker!&#41; <a href = "#Source_1">[1]</a>
		</p>
		<h2>Misconceptions</h2>
		<p>
		Due to century eggs meaning &ldquo;horse urine eggs&rdquo; when translated from Thai, some believe that this is very much the case. 
		This piece of information is <span class = "bolded">evidently false</span>, as mentioned above and proven to be so by many 
		<a href = "https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3057640">online resources</a>. Therefore, do not let these rumours get to you and 
		try this peculiar dish out! <a href = "#Source_2">[2]</a>
